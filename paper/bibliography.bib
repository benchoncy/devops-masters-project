The field of orthopedics, in particular, is uniquely suited to harness the power of big data, and in doing so provide critical insight into elevating the many facets of care provided by orthopedic surgeons. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the recent and novel literature regarding ML in the field of orthopedics and to address its potential impact on the future of musculoskeletal care. Recent Findings Recent literature demonstrates that the incorporation of ML into orthopedics has the potential to elevate patient care through alternative patient-specific payment models, rapidly analyze imaging modalities, and remotely monitor patients. Summary Just as the business of medicine was once considered outside the domain of the orthopedic surgeon, we report evidence that demonstrates these emerging applications of AI warrant ownership, leverage, and application by the orthopedic surgeon to better serve their patients and deliver optimal, value-based care.},

Deep Learning (DL) which is a subset of ML, learns using deep neural networks to simulate the human brain. It trains machines to learn techniques and processes individually using computer algorithms, which is also considered to be a role of Artificial Intelligence (AI). In this paper, we study current technical issues related to software development and delivery in organizations that work on ML projects. Therefore, the importance of the Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) concept, which can deliver appropriate solutions for such concerns, is discussed. We investigate commercially available MLOps tool support in software development. The comparison between MLOps tools analyzes the performance of each system and its use cases. Moreover, we examine the features and usability of MLOps tools to identify the most appropriate tool support for given scenarios. Finally, we recognize that there is a shortage in the availability of a fully functional MLOps platform on which processes can be automated by reducing human intervention.},

However, it is highly challenging to automate and operationalize ML products and thus many ML endeavors fail to deliver on their expectations. The paradigm of Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) addresses this issue. MLOps includes several aspects, such as best practices, sets of concepts, and development culture. However, MLOps is still a vague term and its consequences for researchers and professionals are ambiguous. To address this gap, we conduct mixed-method research, including a literature review, a tool review, and expert interviews. As a result of these investigations, we provide an aggregated overview of the necessary principles, components, and roles, as well as the associated architecture and workflows. Furthermore, we furnish a definition of MLOps and highlight open challenges in the field. Finally, this work provides guidance for ML researchers and practitioners who want to automate and operate their ML products with a designated set of technologies.},

In this paper, we study the importance of MLOps in the context of data scientists' daily activities, based on a survey where we collected responses from 331 professionals from 63 different countries in ML domain, indicating on what they were working on in the last three months. Based on the results, up to 40\% respondents say that they work with both models and infrastructure; the majority of the work revolves around relational and time series data; and the largest categories of problems to be solved are predictive analysis, time series data, and computer vision. The biggest perceived problems revolve around data, although there is some awareness of problems related to deploying models to production and related procedures. To hypothesise, we believe that organisations represented in the survey can be divided to three categories - (i) figuring out how to best use data; (ii) focusing on building the first models and getting them to production; and (iii) managing several models, their versions and training datasets, as well as retraining and frequent deployment of retrained models. In the results, the majority of respondents are in category (i) or (ii), focusing on data and models; however the benefits of MLOps only emerge in category (iii) when there is a need for frequent retraining and redeployment. Hence, setting up an MLOps pipeline is a natural step to take, when an organization takes the step from ML as a proof-of-concept to ML as a part of nominal activities.},

When considered together, these responsibilities seem staggering -- how does anyone do MLOps, what are the unaddressed challenges, and what are the implications for tool builders? We conducted semi-structured ethnographic interviews with 18 MLEs working across many applications, including chatbots, autonomous vehicles, and finance. Our interviews expose three variables that govern success for a production ML deployment: Velocity, Validation, and Versioning. We summarize common practices for successful ML experimentation, deployment, and sustaining production performance. Finally, we discuss interviewees' pain points and anti-patterns, with implications for tool design.},

  abstract = {The development and deployment of machine learning (ML) applications differ significantly from traditional applications in many ways, which have led to an increasing need for efficient and reliable production of ML applications and supported infrastructures. Though platforms such as TensorFlow Extended (TFX), ModelOps, and Kubeflow have provided endto-end lifecycle management for ML applications by orchestrating its phases into multistep ML pipelines, their performance is still uncertain. To address this, we built a functional ML platform with DevOps capability from existing continuous integration (CI) or continuous delivery (CD) tools and Kubeflow, constructed and ran ML pipelines to train models with different layers and hyperparameters while time and computing resources consumed were recorded. On this basis, we analyzed the time and resource consumption of each step in the ML pipeline, explored the consumption concerning the ML platform and computational models, and proposed potential performance bottlenecks such as GPU utilization. Our work provides a valuable reference for ML pipeline platform construction in practice.},
